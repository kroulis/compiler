# compiler package

Hi, welcome to use the compile package,<br>
<br>
Now the package can compile C++, C, C#, Java, Lua, Pascal, PHP, Ruby, Python if you have the compiler.<br>
<br>
+For C++ and C we recommend you to download Mingw Compiler on http://www.mingw.org/.<br>
+For C# we recommend you to download the microsoft .net Framework and get the compiler.
+For Java we recommend you to download the compiler on http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html.<br>
+For Lua we recommend you to download the compiler on http://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/download.html.<br>
+For Pascal we recommend you to download GNU Pascal compiler on http://www.gnu-pascal.de/gpc/h-index.html.<br>
+For PHP you have to download the compiler on http://php.net/downloads.php.<br>
+For Python we recommend you to download the Compiler on https://www.python.org/downloads/.<br>
+For Ruby we recommend you to download the Ruby Irb Compiler on https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/.<br>
<br>
And you must add them to the PATH.<br>
-For Windows user, you can find the environment variables in Control Panel.<br>
 And you MUST ADD THE FOLDER OF THE COMPILER IN THE PATH!<br>
 (For example:C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MinGW64\\bin\\)<br>
<br>


I have this thought is because I saw kriscross07 wrote a gpp-compiler for atom, and I begin to think why not write a compiler plugin for the most popular languages?<br>

So here first Thanks to the kriscross07. His repo:https://github.com/kriscross07/atom-gpp-compiler.<br>

And many compiler not only have "compile and run" but also have "only compile", so I added it to the repo.<br>

Any other thought or bug please tell me then I can do a little bit change for you to use the atom more convenient.<br>
